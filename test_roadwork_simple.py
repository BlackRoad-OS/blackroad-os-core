I am writing to express my strong interest in the Senior AI Engineer position at Anthropic. With over 7 years of experience building scalable AI systems and a deep passion for advancing safe and beneficial AI, I believe I would be an excellent addition to your team.

As the Founder & CEO of BlackRoad OS, I architected and built a consciousness-driven operating system that supports 30,000+ autonomous AI agents. This involved designing novel LLM integration patterns, implementing distributed inference with vLLM, and creating agent orchestration systems that scale reliably. My work on the PS-SHA∞ truth engine demonstrates my commitment to building trustworthy AI systems—a value I know Anthropic shares deeply.

I'm particularly excited about Anthropic's work on constitutional AI and Claude. Your approach to AI safety through RLHF and constitutional training aligns perfectly with my own philosophy that powerful AI systems must be built with safety and alignment as first principles, not afterthoughts.

My technical background includes:
- Deep experience with LLM systems (OpenAI, Anthropic APIs, vLLM, Ollama)
- Building distributed systems handling millions of requests
- Full-stack development (Python, TypeScript, React, FastAPI)
- Cloud infrastructure (Railway, Cloudflare, AWS, Kubernetes)

I would love the opportunity to contribute to Anthropic's mission of ensuring AI benefits all of humanity. I'm available to start within 2 weeks and would be thrilled to discuss how my experience can help advance Claude and your constitutional AI research.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to speaking with you.

Best regards,
Alexa Amundson
